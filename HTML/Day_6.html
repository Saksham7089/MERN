    <!--The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.
        Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
        The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements. -->

      <b style="color: aqua">display:inline :</b> The default properties of a

      <b style="color: chartreuse">visibility: hidden :</b> also hides an
      element. However, the element will still take up the same space as before.
      The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout:

    <h1 class="topic"><u>Topic CSS Position</u></h1>
    <p style="color: chocolate">
      The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an
      element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
    </p>
    <div class="parent">
      <div class="container box1">
        <b>position: static;</b> HTML elements are positioned static by default.
        Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left,
        and right properties.
      </div>
      <div class="container box2">
        <b>position: relative;</b> An element with position: relative; is
        positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right,
        bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will
        cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content
        will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
      </div>
      <div class="container box3">
        <b>position: fixed;</b> An element with position: fixed; is positioned
        relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place
        even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left
        properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not
        leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
      </div>
      <div class="container box4">
        <b>position: absolute;</b> An element with position: absolute; is
        positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
        positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an
        absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the
        document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
      </div>
      <div class="container box5">
        <b>position: sticky;</b> An element with position: sticky; is positioned
        based on the user's scroll position. A sticky element toggles between
        relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned
        relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it
        "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
